<!--PROBLEM-->
<div class="project-info-container">
<div class="project-stage">PROBLEM</div>
<div class="project-stage-title">Deaf accessibility is often limited in Irish museum experiences</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">While there are no definitive statistics on the size of the Deaf community in Ireland, it’s estimated that over 103,000 people are Deaf or hard-of-hearing. Despite there being more than 200 museums across the country, accessibility for Deaf visitors is inconsistent and lacking. When accommodations do exist, they are typically inconsistent, leaving many Deaf individuals feeling overlooked. Museums tend to prioritize accessibility for visually impaired visitors through descriptive audio tours, but Deaf visitors are left to rely on written wall text, which can be inaccessible and difficult to translate. So where does this leave the Deaf community? Often excluded from fully engaging with cultural experiences.

<div class="project-stage">RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES</div>
<div class="project-stage-title">”Nothing about us without us”</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">Projects I’ve worked on in the past typically involved users I could relate to, we shared common experiences, perspectives, or backgrounds. But designing for the Deaf community was a completely different experience. We don’t share a language, and we come from entirely different cultures.
What I knew from the very beginning was this: Deaf users deserve access, and they deserve intentional, thoughtful design. A phrase that guided me throughout this project was, “Nothing about us without us.” To truly understand our users, I needed to step into their world. That meant building relationships. Our project manager, Robyn, generously shared her experiences as a Deaf person and helped bridge the communication gap throughout the course of the project. We learned about our competitors and users through these methods:</div>

<div class="project-stage-title">A look at museum accessibility</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">I researched EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum, National Museum in Your Pocket, Musée d’Art Moderne de Paris, and Smartify to evaluate what accessibility features were, or weren’t, being offered to the Deaf community. Overall, I found that while some platforms are beginning to introduce Deaf-friendly features like transcripts and sign language content, most still lack basic accessibility such as captions, visual alternatives</div>

<div class="project-stage-title">The Deaf community and their lived experiences</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">
    I spoke with 10 Deaf individuals about their experiences visiting museums, what made those visits either meaningful or frustrating. Some participants used cochlear implants, while others were profoundly Deaf and communicated primarily through Irish Sign Language. A key theme across all conversations was the widespread lack of accessibility in Irish museums. Many expressed a strong desire for independence during their visits, rather than having to rely on staff or request accommodations. Several also emphasized that true inclusion starts with a shift in mindset: the hearing community must recognize that Deaf people lead full lives, with jobs, responsibilities, and interests, and that accessibility should never be an afterthought. It should be embedded from the very beginning.

<div class="project-stage-blurb">Throughout the interviews I noticed some patterns forming in the responses of the participants, particularly regarding the way they remembered (or didn't) to take their medications. I learned that while people are generally curious about their medications and their effects, they don't put much of a routine in place to remember to take them. Two users noted keeping their meds in places that were easily accessible to serve as a visual cue to take them, while other users primarily rely on memory alone.</div>

<div class="project-stage-blurb">With the insights gathered from my research, I began mapping out how to address the most prominent pain points. There were many potential directions (medication interaction and safety info, prescription refills, caregiver support), and it was easy to feel pulled in too many at once. To stay focused, I narrowed the scope to a single goal: helping users build lasting habits around medication adherence. That said, I kept in mind how other features could be integrated later to support a more holistic experience.

These personas helped shape a solution that supports different lifestyles and levels of medication complexity.</div>

I considered the insight from my research that people don't want to interact with an app too much, and thought of more ways/features that could automate the experience as much or as little as someone would like. For instance, scanning the medication packaging to instantly add information, integrating the app with an Apple Watch for reminders, and marking medication as taken or skipped, and the option to set goals, as some users may just want the app for reminders only.</div>

For instance, if I add Spironolactone to my medication list, I will also need to input the time I'm supposed to take it, instead of adding medications and reminders separately. The timing of the reminder can be edited in the "My Medications" page and the user will be able to set multiple reminders for the same medication, in case they want a notification before or at the time of event.</div>

Still, I also needed to think about what the reminders and notifications would look like since that was an integral part of this app. Since streaks and building habits around medication intake were also important, I worked on creating a few pop-up messages and tips that would encourage the user to keep up their good work and continue building stronger habits.</div>
