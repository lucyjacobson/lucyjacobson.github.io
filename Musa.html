<!--PROBLEM-->
<div class="project-info-container">
<div class="project-stage">PROBLEM</div>
<div class="project-stage-title">Deaf accessibility is often limited in Irish museum experiences</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">While there are no definitive statistics on the size of the Deaf community in Ireland, it’s estimated that over 103,000 people are Deaf or hard-of-hearing. Despite there being more than 200 museums across the country, accessibility for Deaf visitors is inconsistent and lacking. When accommodations do exist, they are typically inconsistent, leaving many Deaf individuals feeling overlooked. Museums tend to prioritize accessibility for visually impaired visitors through descriptive audio tours, but Deaf visitors are left to rely on written wall text, which can be inaccessible and difficult to translate. So where does this leave the Deaf community? Often excluded from fully engaging with cultural experiences.

<div class="project-stage">RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES</div>
<div class="project-stage-title">”Nothing about us without us”</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">Projects I’ve worked on in the past typically involved users I could relate to, we shared common experiences, perspectives, or backgrounds. But designing for the Deaf community was a completely different experience. We don’t share a language, and we come from entirely different cultures.
What I knew from the very beginning was this: Deaf users deserve access, and they deserve intentional, thoughtful design. A phrase that guided me throughout this project was, “Nothing about us without us.” To truly understand our users, I needed to step into their world. That meant building relationships. Our project manager, Robyn, generously shared her experiences as a Deaf person and helped bridge the communication gap throughout the course of the project. We learned about our competitors and users through these methods:</div>

<div class="project-stage-title">A look at museum accessibility</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">I researched EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum, National Museum in Your Pocket, Musée d’Art Moderne de Paris, and Smartify to evaluate what accessibility features were, or weren’t, being offered to the Deaf community. Overall, I found that while some platforms are beginning to introduce Deaf-friendly features like transcripts and sign language content, most still lack basic accessibility such as captions, visual alternatives</div>

<div class="project-stage-title">The Deaf community and their lived experiences</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">
    I spoke with 10 Deaf individuals about their experiences visiting museums, what made those visits either meaningful or frustrating. Some participants used cochlear implants, while others were profoundly Deaf and communicated primarily through Irish Sign Language. A key theme across all conversations was the widespread lack of accessibility in Irish museums. Many expressed a strong desire for independence during their visits, rather than having to rely on staff or request accommodations. Several also emphasized that true inclusion starts with a shift in mindset: the hearing community must recognize that Deaf people lead full lives, with jobs, responsibilities, and interests, and that accessibility should never be an afterthought. It should be embedded from the very beginning.

<div class="project-stage-title">Insights gathered from the focus group</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb">Our focus group conversations revealed just how challenging it can be for Deaf individuals to visit museums. As the pain points were being discussed, I began thinking of ways to mitigate the accessibility barriers faced by our users. A common suggestion was to make museum content as visual and engaging as possible.  When one of your sense is limited or completely lost, others, like sight, become even more important, and for Deaf users, visual communication is essential. The focus group gave us insight into content preferences, interpreter styles, and how users would like to interact with the platform, through features like games, quizzes and 3D models.</div>

<div class="project-stage-title">Defining project, user, business, and technical goals</div>
<div class="project-stage-blurb"> As the research phase progressed, I identified key objectives that would define what success for the project would look like. An important goal worth noting is ensuring compliance with the ISL Act of 2017, recognizing that Irish Sign Language is Ireland's third official language. While this represents a legal requirement for museums from a business perspective, it simultaneously addresses a fundamental user need by making cultural institutions truly accessible to the deaf community.</div>

It highlighted how Deaf users are more likely to engage with a platform when it visibly centers their needs. For example, through the use of ISL interpreted videos and minimal reliance on text. Longterm engagement depends on continuous content updates and expanding access to more museums, because without growth and variety, user interest fades quickly.</div>

In this case, you’ll see our partner museum, the Hunt, listed under the “Museums” menu.</div>

These small additions help users form stronger, more consistent habits.</div>
